# Contributing

## Process
- Have a look at the Issues and Projects tab to identify an issue you would be intersted in working on
- Assign yourself to the issue (or create a new issue if an appropriate one doesn't exist)
- Create a branch for to make your changes (see [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) if you're not familar with git branching)
- Each issue has a "Definition of Done" which is intended to be a checklist of things to consider
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into **develop**. 
- Your pull request will need to be approved by Jade, Kale-ab or Avishkar before it can be merged.

- Don't worry if you are not too familiar with the technologies or conventions used - we can iterate during the pull request review process. This is intended to be a learning opportunity for all of us!
